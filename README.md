# Big-5-Personality-Type-Clustering
An analysis to determine if a personality type system can be derived from the Five Factor model.

The Five Factor Model of personality also known as the Big Five personality traits is a taxonomy of personality traits that is the dominant model of personality in psychology. Other models exist such as Myers-Briggs, the Enneagram, and others that many have found to be personally insightful but lack the empirical backing of the Big 5. The Big 5 is trait based, meaning all people have each aspect to varying degrees, as opposed to most systems that are type based, where people are placed in a certain category with limited interaction to the others. Here I used K-means clustering to determine if the Big 5 model can be typified or if the concept of types in the context of the Big 5 is truly a bad framing of personality.

The traits of the Big 5 Model:

Openness to Experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious): Distinguishes imaginative, creative people from down-to-earth, conventional people. It describes a person's tendency to think abstractly, appreciate art, experience emotions, try new things, and be open-minded.

Conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless): Refers to a person's degree of organization, responsibility, dependability, and ambition. Highly conscientious people tend to be organized and mindful of details. They plan ahead, think about how their behavior affects others, and are mindful of deadlines.

Extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved): Signifies an outgoing, energetic orientation towards the social and material world, and includes traits such as sociability, assertiveness, and high amounts of emotional expressiveness.

Agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached): Reflects individual differences in general concern for social harmony. Agreeable individuals tend to be friendly, cooperative, and compassionate. Disagreeable individuals are self-interested, skeptical of others' intentions, and competitive rather than cooperative.

Neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident): Reflects the tendency to experience negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, depression, or vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control, and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, "emotional stability."
